### Viewing the high-fidelity prototype

The high-fidelity prototype can be accessed via [figma's website](https://www.figma.com/file/Xmit6kEwCE30QLxYb5rysC/Telstra-Dat-Normalisation?node-id=0%3A1) (not password protected). We have also provided a .fig file containing the prototype.

We have also provided a non interactive .pdf copy of the prototype slides. This may be use to anyone hoping to take a closer look at individual slides, but isn't interactive and lacks a meaningful slide order or structure. As such, it should only be used as a supplement to the actual prototype.
