# Accessing the high-fidelity prototype

The high-fidelity prototype can be accessed in 2 ways -

- [Edit & Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/Xmit6kEwCE30QLxYb5rysC/Telstra-Dat-Normalisation?node-id=0%3A1)

- [Play and InteractÂ on Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/Xmit6kEwCE30QLxYb5rysC/Telstra-Dat-Normalisation?node-id=1%3A3&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1)

We have also provided a .fig file containing the prototype.

Additionally, we've provided a .pdf copy of the prototype slides. This may be use to anyone hoping to take a closer look at individual pages, but isn't interactive and lacks a meaningful slide order or structure. As such, it should only be used as a supplement to the actual prototype.
